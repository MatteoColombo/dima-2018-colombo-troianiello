\chapter{Overall Description}

\section{Product Perspective}
NonSoloLibri will be developed from scratch and will be a mobile application that runs on
both iOS and Android. 

Data will be stored online so that they can retrieved from every device and to provide a sort of back-up option.
Thus, users will be required to have a smartphone or tablet and a Google account to sign in.

In the application the users will be able to make use of their device hardware to capture pictures of books and libraries or to scan the book barcodes.

Verifying users will be mandatory in order to let them access to the market place, to security layer and discourage bad behaviours.

\section{Actors}

We individuated three main actors for the application:

\begin{description}
    \item[Visitor] A person who has yet to login to the application and can only see the login page.
    \item[User] A visitor who successfully logged in into the application and can access to all the main feature of the aplication.
    \item[Verified User] An user who successfully verified himself and can access to the market place.
\end{description}

\section{Use Cases Diagram}
The main actors have different functionalities, according to the previous definitions. \\
The visitior can only perform the login, the user can also make other things, like to manage the library or review a book.
Verified user can interact with the market functions.\\
All the functions are shown using the following use case diagram:
